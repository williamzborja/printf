A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifier and their meanings are:
.TP
.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, then the resulting character is written
.TP
.B s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are
written up to a terminating null byte, but do ot include the terminating null byte.
.TP
.B b
The unsigned int argument is converted to binary notation.
.TP
.B r
Prints a string in reverse.
